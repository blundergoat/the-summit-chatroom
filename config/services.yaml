# Symfony Dependency Injection (DI) Configuration
# =============================================================================
#
# This file tells Symfony how to create and wire up your application's services
# (classes). Symfony's DI container automatically creates instances of your
# classes and injects their dependencies (constructor arguments).
#
# KEY CONCEPTS FOR BEGINNERS:
#
#   "autowire: true"      - Symfony looks at constructor type-hints and automatically
#                            injects the right service. For example, if a constructor
#                            asks for HubInterface, Symfony injects the Mercure hub.
#
#   "autoconfigure: true" - Symfony automatically tags services based on the interfaces
#                            they implement (e.g., controllers are auto-tagged as
#                            controllers, event subscribers are auto-tagged, etc.)
#
#   "resource: '../src/'" - Registers ALL classes in src/ as services automatically.
#                            Combined with autowire, this means you just create a class
#                            with type-hinted constructor params, and Symfony handles the rest.
#
#   "exclude: '../src/Kernel.php'" - Don't register the Kernel as a service (it's special).
#
# In practice, you rarely need to touch this file. Just create classes in src/
# with proper type hints, and Symfony wires everything up automatically.
