# Strands Agent Configuration
# =============================================================================
#
# This file configures a single StrandsClient instance shared by all summit
# personas. The StrandsBundle reads this and registers it as a named service
# in the DI container: "strands.client.summit".
#
# The orchestrators use this one client for all persona requests. The persona
# name is sent as metadata in each request, and the Python agent uses it to
# select the appropriate system prompt.
#
# CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
#
#   endpoint - The HTTP URL of the Python agent (running in Docker via docker-compose.yml)
#              The %env(AGENT_ENDPOINT)% syntax reads from the AGENT_ENDPOINT environment
#              variable (set in docker-compose.yml as http://agent:8000)
#
#   timeout         - Overall max seconds for the request (default: 120).
#                     300 seconds (5 minutes) is generous because LLM responses can be slow,
#                     especially with large Ollama models on CPU.
#
#   connect_timeout - Idle timeout: max seconds to wait for first byte / between chunks
#                     (default: 10). Must be high for sync mode since the agent calls
#                     Bedrock 3 times before responding.
#
#   auth.driver     - Authentication method for the agent endpoint:
#                     "null" - No authentication (supported by the current client version)
